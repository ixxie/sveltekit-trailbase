# SvelteKit TrailBase Sandbox

This is an experimental setup of a SvelteKit project with TrailBase.

## Notes

- Why is Docker needed when TrailBase is a single binary?
- If Docker is indeed needed, perhaps a docker compose could simplify the command
- Migration SQL in INFO lvl logs is spammy
- Table creation and altering sidebar is quite narrow; I would prefer a full screen interface
